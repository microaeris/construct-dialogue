I've been waiting for over an hour to meet my new boss, Amara something or other. She mentioned it during the interview, and I let it fall out of my memory after the last handshake; unbelieving at the time that she would be the only one to call me back.

I should be running this place, with a dozen code monkeys at my beck and call, a PA to get me coffee and a secretary to take all my calls while I did the only real work in the building.

Instead, I'm stuck at a private research firm in California.

I dusted off my clothes, again. They haven't been out of the closet for a year, so I'm glad they still fit properly. My former PA used to tease me that they were dated even before now, but I still don't see the point in caring about insipid things like fashion.

They're clean, pressed, and matching, but when I run my burnt fingers over them I can't help but feel slovenly. I had to learn how to iron my own clothes, because there is no money for dry cleaning anymore.

Apparently, you're supposed to flick water at the foul machine to check if it's hot enough, not use your fingers, according to the instruction manual I dug up from the library.

It's another fifteen minutes before someone comes down to give me the grand tour for my first day. I take in what I can from where I'm standing.

When I look right, I can see the secretary through frosted glass.

She's typing quickly and trying to sneak glances at me.

Whether she notices me noticing her doing so, she doesn't break from her strict professionalism.

To the left, I can see a few rooms behind sharply closed doors lining the hall.

Most have name plates on them—senior staff and developers then.

Three and a half strides down the hall on the right is a door slightly ajar.

I lean forward, rolling on the balls of my feet.

Step once, twice, and manage to examine the door more closely.

The door is open a hands width.

I can see a coffee machine through the crack. The edge of a sink.

Bright feminine laughter spilling out. I recoil at the sound.

A hand comes into view, then another, pulling coffee from the machine, unhurried.

Whoever it is, was sporting a watch.

I don't care for baubles, but even I can tell that the watch is expensive.

It's classy though, filigreed with gold.

The main diamond is inlaid with a chain of smaller ones on either side.

Wealthy without being showy.

On the one hand, such a display of wealth means that this company does well, for itself.

I'm not just working in some basement with flickering lights.

I have a chance to prove myself with a group doing real science, with a woman at the helm.

On the other hand, well, I cringe at seeing another hand take the cup of coffee from the first.

And at the muffled laughter and gentle words.

Gut curdling at the thought of playing nice with simpletons.

Well-manicured, bejewelled hand opens the door.

I snap back to standing in front of the wall.

Looking straight ahead and folding my own hands in front of me—

A gesture of conciliation I practiced often.

The woman who comes out of the break room is imposing, shorter than I.

But with a sharp gaze that more than makes up for the inches between us.

Her suit is so crisp and clean it makes me feel even more slovenly.

Before I have time to wallow in the feeling, she's in front of me.

I take the offered handshake, remembering to squeeze 1… 2… 3…, not too hard.

Shake up just right and look at her nose to make it seem like I'm keeping eye contact.

Amara: Hello Simra, welcome to Conwell Labs. Come, walk and I'll give you a tour.

Amara is straight to business as soon as the handshake is complete.

She moves her hand to the small of my back, but not touching (which I appreciate).

She directs me down the hall I looked over earlier.

The tour is standard, with Amara pointing out the individual offices, break room.

And points out where we'll do most of our coding and experiments.

Before we enter the final room, she turns to me with a critical eye, crossing her arms.

Amara: "Consider this a clean slate. I have high expectations.A

Amara: And I'm trusting you'll meet them.

Amar: Someone stuck a limb out and pushed for your project, even risking their own."

Simra: "Who the hell would do that?"

Especially if they know what I did just who I am. I wince at the expletive.

Five minutes in and already forgetting how to be human properly.

Amara: "Just focus on doing your best."

She concludes the tour in the office I will be using.

# Background: shared office

The office with two desks, two chairs, and two unfinished nameplates.

I bristle at the implication.

Simra: "I don't need a teammate."

Amara purses her lips, pausing as if unsure what to say.

I've never seen her lost for words before.

Eventually she continues.

Voice painted with the kind of sigh that says she shouldn't have to explain this to me.

Amara: "Not a teammate. Things are different here Simra, we'll be starting a number of projects.

Amara: Whichever one performs the best will be given full funding."

I swallow heavily.

Simra: "And what happens to whoever doesn't get funding."

Amara just shrugs, dismissive.

Amara: "I think you can figure that out on your own, Simra.

Amara:You have to prove to everyone else you deserve to stay in this industry despite your blacklisting."

Right. The blacklisting that ruined everything.

All for one step out of line, one moment of free experimentation outside of the machinery.

I swallow down all my complaints, but don't bother to hide them from my body language.

Simra: "You'll see soon enough why I'm the best."

Amara looks at me tightly.

Amara: "I really hope I do Simra."

And then she turns, tight and fast, swiveling like a model.

Changing her mind, she turns back, pointing at the desk.

Amara: "You should know, Simra, the person you're competing against?

Amara:They're the one that stuck their neck out for you. Don't waste their time."

And then she sweeps out of the room without another word, pulling the door closed behind her with the finality of a gavel.

Fuck. Fuck.

"Don't waste their time?"

Why'd she have to be such a bitch about it.

# Background: rooftop

I'm pacing the roof.

Clenching my hands because I won't be able to afford cigs until I finally get paid again.

It's surprisingly small, given the floor plan of the building.

Seems like nobody else comes up here.

I want to go back down there, to really tell Amara off.

It was never like this when we went to school together.

When did she become this brazen and confident?

Who does she think she is?

My boss. She's the woman who is putting her reputation on the line employing me.

But even she has some reason to do it. I do good work.

This stranger though.

This professione computer science industry is not one you go into to make friends.

People to drink with? Of course.

People to step on until you get to the top? Absolutely.

Mediocrity to crush underfoot in the pursuit of progress.

And ultimately, your name enshrined as a god of something.

It's not… Nobody looks out for you. Least of all people like me.

I feel my eyes sting.

It's dusty on the roof of course, and the breeze wicks it up into my face.

I grind my palm into my eyes, as the wind picks up.

I'm remembering school now, remembering how easy computational mathematics was.

The way that numbers are orderly and rational.

In the way the humans around me never were.

None of it makes sense.

Least of all this stranger, who seems to care for someone they've never met.

Who believes in them. What kind of nonsense is that?

I blink hard and nearly slam into someone. They're soft. Soft and warm.

I hadn't noticed them come onto the roof, but I see it now.

The heavy door whispering shut.

The grit of their shoes where they're scuffing their toes into the tilestar.

The annoying way they seem unable to stand still, some part of them always moving.

The sun is behind me, and it obscures their face in the brightness of the afternoon.

I squint past my tears and sniffle wetly.

I snarl, my face twisting, my hands curling my hands into fists at my sides.

I was about to slam my shoulder into this stranger's as I leave the roof.

Punish them for having the gall to follow me, to watch as I breakdown and laugh.

???: "This roof is the shittiest place to have a breakdown, right?"

They hold out a handkerchief as they say it, giggling into their other hand.

It's so forward I can't help but respect it, as it knocks the frustration clean out of me.

Fuck. I guess I'm the bitch this time.

Simra: "Yeah, it is."

I admit, taking their offering.

I wipe my face, grimacing when it comes back wet and snotty. Ugh.

They've turned away and are looking out across the city, rocking on the balls of their feet.

???: "I like coming up here because nobody else knows about it. People clearly used to."

???: "But I don't think maintenance remembers that we even have roof access anymore."

???: "It's calm, when things are overwhelming."

???: "You can see the forest that edges the city from here too."

They point to a thin strip of green cradling the east side of the city.

I've always been ambivalent at best about nature.

Wherever I can be programming is where I want to be.

But something about the way they talk about it makes me reconsider.

They shrug, turned away from me now.

???: "So, what's your poison, why are you breaking down all by yourself on a dirty roof, gorgeous?"

Simra:"Work."

I shrug, crumpling the handkerchief to have something to do.

???: "Mine's family."

The stranger chuckles darkly.

I snort, and we share a laugh at that.

They hold out another gift, whirling back around on me, sun still blinding me.

???: "Cigarette?"

???: "I'd stay and smoke one with you, but I only have 5 minutes for my breakdowns and I've already used 4 of them."

Before I can get a good look at them, the sun finally moving behind a cloud.

They leave me behind in a wave of kicked up dirt, cigarette sagging between my fingers.

Who was that? And why do I want to know more about them?
